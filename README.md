![Apache Kudu](https://d3dr9sfxru4sde.cloudfront.net/i/k/apachekudu_logo_0716_345px.png)

## What is Kudu?
Kudu provides a combination of fast inserts/updates and efficient columnar scans to enable multiple real-time analytic workloads across a single storage layer. As a new complement to HDFS and Apache HBase, Kudu gives architects the flexibility to address a wider variety of use cases without exotic workarounds.
